};

  answers: ["The recording device alters the sound", "You hear your voice through vibrations in your skull", "The environment changes the sound", "Your ears are not functioning properly"],
  correct: 1
};

let question3 = {
  question: `3. Why do we perceive a sound as "louder" when we are closer to the source?`,
  answers: ["Sound waves travel faster at shorter distances", "The amplitude of sound waves increases with distance", "Sound waves spread out and lose energy as they travel", "Our ears become more sensitive at closer distances"],
  correct: 2
};

let question4 = {
  question: `4. Why do you hear a "pop" sound when you open a soda can?`,
  answers: ["The can is under high pressure", "The sound is produced by the liquid", "The can is made of metal", "The carbonation is escaping slowly"],

  question: "5. Why do some people find it difficult to hear conversations in a crowded room?",
  answers: ["Sound waves are blocked by other people", "The brain cannot process multiple sounds at once", "Sound waves lose energy in a crowd", "High-frequency sounds are absorbed by the crowd"],
  correct: 1
};

  question: "6. Why does a dog seem to hear sounds that humans cannot?",
  answers: ["Dogs have better hearing abilities", "Dogs can hear higher frequencies than humans", "Dogs are more sensitive to vibrations", "All of the above"],
  correct: 3
};

let question7 = {
  question: "7. Why do we often hear echoes in large, empty spaces like canyons?",
  answers: ["Sound travels faster in open spaces", "Sound waves bounce off hard surfaces", "There are fewer obstacles to absorb sound", "The air is less dense in canyons"],
  correct: 1
};

let question8 = {
  question: "8. Why does music sound different when played through headphones compared to speakers?",
  answers: ["Headphones amplify sound differently", "Speakers produce sound waves that fill a room", "Headphones only transmit certain frequencies", "The position of the listener affects sound perception"],
  correct: 1
};

let question9 = {
  question: `9. Why do we sometimes hear a "ringing" in our ears after a loud concert?`,
  answers: ["The ears are damaged from loud sounds", "The brain is processing sound incorrectly", "The sound waves are still vibrating in the air", "It is a sign of hearing loss"],
  correct: 0
};

let question10 = {
  question: `10. Why do you hear a "thud" when you drop a heavy object on the floor?`,
  answers: ["The object is too heavy for the floor", "The sound is produced by the object hitting the floor", "The floor absorbs the sound", "The air pressure changes when the object falls"],
