## Title Slide

🎤 **Full Presentation Script: Contact Forces & Moment of Force**

### Title: Contact Forces & Moment of Force

**Narration:**
> "Hey everyone! Today we're exploring the forces you feel, use, and maybe even fight against daily — *Contact Forces*.
>
> And we'll also uncover a secret weapon of physics… the *Moment of Force* — the science behind opening doors, swinging bats, and more!"

---

## What Are Contact Forces?

🧲

**Narration:**
> "Contact forces are forces that occur when two objects physically touch.
>
> You can't push a box without touching it — that's a contact force!
> Let's explore them all one by one."

---

## Muscular Force

💪

**Narration:**
> "When you lift your school bag, pull a chair, or throw a ball — you're using *muscular force*.
>
> It's the force produced by your muscles, and it needs direct contact to act."

> **Fun fact:** Even blinking your eyes uses muscular force!

---

## Frictional Force

🛑

**Narration:**
> *Friction* is what stops things from sliding forever.
>
> It opposes motion between two surfaces that touch.
>
> Try sliding a book on a smooth vs. rough table — which one slows down faster?

> **Fun Fact:** Without friction, we'd slip and slide everywhere!

---

## Tension Force

🧵

**Narration:**
> "*Tension* is the pulling force in a rope or string.
>
> Think: Tug of War or lifting a water bucket from a well — the rope carries the force."

---

## Normal & Applied Force

🧍

**Narration:**
> "When you place a book on a table:
> - Your hand gives an *applied force* to place it.
> - The table gives a *normal force* upward to support it.
>
> These two contact forces balance to keep the book still."

---

## Quick Real-Life Examples

🤸

**Narration:**
> "See how almost everything we do involves contact forces?
>
> - *Activity - Force Involved:*
>   - Writing with a pencil - Muscular + Friction
>   - Swinging on a swing - Tension + Gravity
>   - Kicking a ball - Muscular + Friction
>   - Climbing a rope - Tension + Muscular"

## Introduction to Moment of Force

⚙️

**Narration:**
> "Now let's turn up the power.
> What makes a door swing open?
> Why does a seesaw tilt?
>
> It's all because of the *Moment of Force* — also called the *Turning Effect* of force or *Torque*."

---

## What is Moment of Force?

🔄

**Narration:**
> "The moment of a force is the force's ability to rotate an object around a point.
>
> The formula is simple but powerful:
>
> ```julia
> Moment = Force × Perpendicular Distance from Pivot
> ```
>
> The larger the distance, the stronger the turning effect!"

---

## Examples of Moment of Force

🛠️

**Narration:**
> - Opening a door — Push near the handle, `far from the hinge = more turning`.
> - Using a wrench, `Longer handle = more torque`.
> - Seesaw, Weight and position matter.
> - Swinging a bat, `Hands near end = better moment`.
>
> Ever tried opening a door by pushing near the hinge? Hard, right?

---

## Clockwise vs Anti-Clockwise Moments

🧪

**Narration:**
> "Moments can turn objects in two directions:
> - *Clockwise Moment* – Turns like a clock hand
> - *Anti-clockwise Moment* – Opposite direction
>
> Both are used in balance situations, like on a seesaw or balance scale."

---

## Principle of Moments

⚖️

**Narration:**
> "*If an object is balanced*"
>
> ```julia
> Total Clockwise Moment = Total Anti-Clockwise Moment
> ```
>
> This is the secret behind weighing machines, cranes, and even playground rides."

## Summary of Concepts

📚

**Narration:**
> - **Contact Forces vs Moment of Force**
> - **Contact Forces:**
>   - Require physical touch
>   - Push, pull, oppose
>   - Muscular, friction, etc.
>
> - **Moment of Force:**
>   - Turning effect of a force
>   - Depends on force & distance
>   - Seen in levers, hinges, tools"

## Quiz Time

🧠

**Sample Questions:**
1. Which force opposes motion? (*Friction*)
2. What force is used to lift a bucket by a rope? (*Tension*)
3. What is the formula for Moment of Force? (*Force × Distance*)
4. A longer wrench makes work easier. Why? (*Greater moment*)

---

## Conclusion

🥳

**Narration:**
> "*Contact forces* help us interact with the world — pushing, pulling, holding, stopping.
>
> And the `moment of force` adds rotation and balance to it all.
>
> These invisible forces shape every action — from writing notes to playing cricket!"
