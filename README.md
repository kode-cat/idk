**🎬 Title Slide**

🎙️ Narration:

> “Hello everyone! Ever wondered why you don’t fall through your chair? Or how a tiny hand can open a huge door?

Today we’ll discover the invisible heroes in action — Contact Forces and Moments of Force. Get ready for some twist-and-turn physics!”




---

**🧲 What Are Contact Forces?**

🎙️ Narration:

> “Imagine trying to push your friend… without touching them. That’s a superpower — but not contact force.

Contact forces only happen when two things touch. They’re the reason we can walk, write, and play football!”




---

**💪 Muscular Force**

🎙️ Narration:

> “Every time you blink, carry a bag, or even smile — your muscles are pulling off physics!

Muscular force is your body's personal power supply. No gym required.”



> 🧠 Fun Fact: Your tongue is one of the strongest muscles in proportion to its size!




---

**🛑 Frictional Force**

🎙️ Narration:

> “Try sliding on a polished floor in socks — wheeee!

Now try it on a carpet — not so fun.

That’s friction, the grip that keeps you grounded.”



> ⚡ Without friction, we’d all be moonwalking 24/7!




---

**🧵 Tension Force**

🎙️ Narration:

> “Ever played Tug of War? The rope’s under tension!

Tension force is that pull felt in ropes, cables, and even spider webs.

It’s always pulling — never pushing.”




---

**🧍 Normal & Applied Forces**

🎙️ Narration:

> “Place a book on a table.

Your hand applied a force to put it there.

The table pushes back — this is the normal force (aka the table’s way of saying “Not today, gravity!”).


Together, they balance the book.”




---

**🏃 Quick Real-Life Examples**

🎙️ Narration:

> “Let’s connect the dots!

* ✏️ Writing = Muscular + Friction
* ⚽ Kicking a ball = Muscular + Friction
* 🤸 Swing = Tension + Gravity
* 🧗 Climbing a rope = Muscular + Tension


Almost every action around us is powered by contact forces!”

---

**⚙️ Introduction to Moment of Force**

🎙️ Narration:

> “Here’s a twist — literally.

Ever struggled to open a tight jar lid? Or swung a door wide open with a single finger?

That’s the Moment of Force in action — the twisty cousin of push and pull.”




---

**🔁 What is Moment of Force?**

🎙️ Narration:

> “A moment is a force that causes rotation around a pivot.
>
> Here’s the formula:
  ```julia
  Moment = Force × Perpendicular Distance from Pivot
  ```
>
> The bigger the distance, the easier the turn — just like using a long wrench.”




---

**🔧 Examples of Moment of Force**

🎙️ Narration:

* “🛠️ Opening a door — push near the handle, not the hinge!

* ⚖️ Using a spanner — `longer the handle = easier twist`

* ⚾ Hitting a ball — `hold the bat at the end = stronger swing`

* 🧍 `Standing on a seesaw = moment depends on weight & position`”


> 💡 Pro Tip: `Moment = Twist Power!`




---

**🔄 Clockwise vs Anti-Clockwise Moments**

🎙️ Narration:

> “Moments spin in two directions:
> 
> Clockwise: like the hands of a clock
> 
> Anti-clockwise: the opposite


Think of a balance scale. One side goes down ⬇️, the other up ⬆️. That’s moments playing tug-of-war!”

---

**⚖️ Principle of Moments**

🎙️ Narration:

> “Here’s physics’ secret balancing act:
> ```julia
>  Clockwise Moment = Anti-Clockwise Moment
> ```
> If this equation holds, the object stays in perfect balance.

This principle powers cranes, levers, and weighing scales!”

**📚 Summary**

🎙️ Narration:

🌯 Let’s wrap it up:
* Contact Forces:
  * Involve touch
  * Push, pull, support
  * Includes muscular, friction, tension, normal, applied
* Moment of Force:
  * A rotating force
  * Depends on distance from pivot
  * Used in levers, tools, doors

**🎯 Conclusion**

🎙️ Narration:

> “From tying your shoelaces to opening a jam jar — these forces are your invisible assistants.

Contact forces get things done.
Moments make things move.

Physics isn't just in the lab — it's in your hands. Literally.”
